            <h3 id="death">How Eriri Dies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>mentioned last meeting: she dies <strong>prior to their wedding</strong> (age at death: 19, very close to 20)</li>
                <li>maybe she gets killed in some invasion, where leo <em>fails</em> to protect her?
                    <ul>
                        <li>too traumatic for leo; he might not be able to recover from the guilt</li>
                        <li>maybe something more peaceful would be better</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>maybe something peaceful that would be common around the 1500s instead
                    <ul>
                        <li>perhaps a sudden illness?
                        <ul>
                            <li>something that could be preventable in modern society (for potential au timeline)
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>pneumonia</strong> (modern society has antibiotics to treat it; fatal back then)</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>

            <ul>
                <li>how does he know
                    <ul>
                        <li>makes more sense for him to be there by her side since they're <em>engaged</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>should be there until her last breath</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>are they able to say goodbye to each other?
                    <ul>
                        <li>doesn't fit their dynamic to say goodbye (leo's theme is eternal love)
                            <ul>
                                <li>instead <strong>eriri tells him that they'll meet again</strong>?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>despite her condition, she's able to sense his fears and tries to soothe him in her <em>last</em> moments</li>
                                        <li>he understands her intentions and tries to calm down in order to reply with the same feelings</li>
                                </ul>
                                </li>

                <li>what about after she passes
                    <ul>
                        <li>does reality hit him immediately
                            <ul>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>despite eriri's attempt, leo <em>loses</em> it after he no longer feels her strength from her hands</li>
                                        <li><em>less</em> crying, but <strong>more</strong> chaos in his mind</li>
                                        <li>unwilling to part from her body for a couple hours
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>maybe it takes his parents to calm him down?</li>
                                                <li>or maybe it takes their mutual friend to wake him up</li>
                                                <li>will decide <strong>next</strong> meeting</li>

                    He didn't want to entertain the possibility. <i>Please let her be okay. I can't lose her, not now. Not ever.</i><br>
                    He rushed into her room, struggling to breathe properly. There she laid resting, her face crimson red from her high body temperature. He stumbled into the chair beside her, instinctively reaching for her hands. They were burning hot and a little damp from sweating. He pulled them closer to him, placing them against his forehead.
                    He gradually brought them down to his lips, kissing them ever so gently. His hands were shaking from the fear. The doctor had warned him before he came in, but he didn't want to believe. Believe that she could stop breathing at any moment. They still had so much to live for. Together.

                                                <li>might not be in the <em>right</em> mindset to be a healer though</li>
