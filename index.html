            <h3 class="topics">How Eriri Dies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>mentioned last meeting: she dies <strong>prior to their wedding</strong> (age at death: 19, very close to 20)</li>
                <li>maybe she gets killed in some invasion, where leo <em style="color:crimson;">fails</em> to protect her?
                    <ul>
                        <li>too traumatic for leo; he might not be able to recover from the guilt</li>
                        <li>maybe something more peaceful would be better</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>maybe something peaceful that would be common around the 1500s instead
                    <ul>
                        <li>perhaps a sudden illness?
                        <ul>
                            <li>something that could be preventable in modern society (for potential au timeline)
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>pneumonia</strong> (modern society has antibiotics to treat it; fatal back then)</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>

                    He rushed into her room, struggling to breathe properly. There she laid resting, her face crimson red from her high body temperature. He stumbled into the chair beside her, instinctively reaching for her hands. They were burning hot and a little damp from sweating. He pulled them closer to him, placing them against his forehead.
                    He gradually brought them down to his lips, kissing them ever so gently. His hands were shaking from the fear. The doctor had warned him before he came in, but he didn't want to believe. Believe that she could stop breathing at any moment. They still had so much to live for. Together.
